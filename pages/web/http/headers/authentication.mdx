# HTTP Authentication

The general HTTP authentication flow is as follows. Note the use of the following headers:

- `WWW-Authenticate` (sent by the server)
- `Authorization` (sent by the client)

There are several [authentication type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication#authentication_schemes) maintained by IANA. The most common one is `Basic` (i.e. `WWW-Authenticate: Basic`).

## Relevant Headers

### `WWW-Authenticate`

Defines the authentication method that should be used to gain access to a resource. It's sent with a 401 (Unauthorized) response.

- **`<type>`** &mdash; the authentication type, e.g. `Basic`
- **`realm=<realm>`** &mdash; a description of the protected area, e.g. `realm="Access to the staging site"`
- **`charset=<charset>`** &mdash; the server's preferred encoding when submitting a username and password. Only `UTF-8` is allowed.

```http
WWW-Authenticate: <type> realm=<realm>
WWW-Authenticate: <type> realm=<realm>, charset="UTF-8"
```

### `Proxy-Authenticate`

Like `WWW-Authenticate`, but for proxy servers. It's sent with a 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) response.

```http
Proxy-Authenticate: <type> realm=<realm>
```

### `Authorization`

Provides credentials to authenticate a user agent.

- **`<type>`** &mdash; the authentication type, e.g. `Basic`
- **`<credentials>`** &mdash; for authentication type of `Basic`, it's the base64 encoding of the string `<username>:<password>` (use `btoa` function in JavaScript). For instance, `aladdin:opensesame` will become `YWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuc2VzYW1l`.

```http
Authorization: <type> <credentials>
```
