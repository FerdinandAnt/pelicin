# Cookie

Cookies are small pieces of data sent between the server and client. Cookies are used to store state over the stateless HTTP protocol.

## Cookie exchange

### Setting Cookies

The server can instruct the browser to set cookies via response headers:

```http
HTTP/2.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Set-Cookie: yummy_cookie=choco
Set-Cookie: tasty_cookie=strawberry

[page content]
```

Additionally, JavaScript code running on client-side can also instruct the browser to set cookies:

```js
document.cookie = 'yummy_cookie=choco';
document.cookie = 'tasty_cookie=strawberry';

// Logs 'yummy_cookie=choco; tasty_cookie=strawberry'
console.log(document.cookie);
```

### Sending Cookies

The browser will then send the cookies on all future requests to the server:

```http
GET /sample_page.html HTTP/2.0
Host: www.example.org
Cookie: yummy_cookie=choco; tasty_cookie=strawberry
```

## Cookie lifetime

Cookies are deleted on these occasions:

- when the current session ends (browsers have their own definition of "current session", normally until the browser is closed), OR
- when the cookie expiry time specified by the `Expires` or `Max-Age` directive is reached.

```http
Set-Cookie: id=a3fWa; Expires=Thu, 31 Oct 2021 07:28:00 GMT;
```

## Relevant response headers

### `Set-Cookie`

Instructs the client to set a cookie. To set multiple cookies, multiple `Set-Cookie` headers should be set in the same response.

The cookie name/value pair can be followed by directive(s) separated by `;`, e.g. `Set-Cookie: <cookie-name>=<cookie-value>; Domain=<domain-value>; Secure; HttpOnly`.

<Badge color="blue">Name/value</Badge>

- **`<cookie-name>=<cookie-value>`** &mdash; Sets the name and the value of the cookie. `<cookie-value>` can optionally be wrapped in double quotes, and you can also use URL encoding for the value.

<Badge color="blue">Expiration</Badge>

- **`Expires=<date>`** &mdash; Delete the cookie after this date (formatted like `Thu, 31 Oct 2021 07:28:00 GMT`, relative to the client's time).
- **`Max-Age=<non-zero-digit>`** &mdash; Delete the cookie after this many seconds. Has precendence over `Expires`.

<Badge color="blue">Scope</Badge>

- **`Domain=<domain-value>`** &mdash; If specified, only send the cookie to the host of the current document URL and its subdomains. If omitted, only send the cookie to the host of the current document URL, _excluding_ subdomain.
- **`Path=<path-value>`** &mdash; Only send the cookie if the requested URL matches the given path or its subdirectories (e.g. `Path: /a` will match for `/a` and `/a/b`).
- **`Secure`** &mdash; Only send the cookie on HTTPS (except on localhost)
- **`HttpOnly`** &mdash; Disallow JavaScript from reading the value of the cookie (only the browser and the server can read it)

<Badge color="blue">SameSite</Badge>

- **`SameSite=Lax`** &mdash; Only send the cookie for same-site requests, AND if the user is navigating to the site from external sites (e.g. by following a link). This is the default.
- **`SameSite=Strict`** &mdash; Only send the cookie for same-site requests.
- **`SameSite=None`** &mdash; Send the cookie for both cross-site and same-site requests. The `Secure` directive must also be set.

```http
Set-Cookie: <cookie-name>=<cookie-value>

Set-Cookie: <cookie-name>=<cookie-value>; Expires=<date>
Set-Cookie: <cookie-name>=<cookie-value>; Max-Age=<non-zero-digit>

Set-Cookie: <cookie-name>=<cookie-value>; Domain=<domain-value>
Set-Cookie: <cookie-name>=<cookie-value>; Path=<path-value>
Set-Cookie: <cookie-name>=<cookie-value>; Secure
Set-Cookie: <cookie-name>=<cookie-value>; HttpOnly

Set-Cookie: <cookie-name>=<cookie-value>; SameSite=Lax
Set-Cookie: <cookie-name>=<cookie-value>; SameSite=Strict
Set-Cookie: <cookie-name>=<cookie-value>; SameSite=None
```

## Relevant request headers

### `Cookie`

Lists the cookie name/value pairs.

```http
Cookie: name=value
Cookie: name=value; name2=value2; name3=value3; ...
```
