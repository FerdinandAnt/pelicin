# HTTP Response Status Codes

HTTP status codes indicate the status of an HTTP request (e.g. succesful, error, etc.). They are grouped into five classes:

- **1xx** &mdash; Informational
- **2xx** &mdash; Succesful
- **3xx** &mdash; Redirection
- **4xx** &mdash; Client Error
- **5xx** &mdash; Server Error

This page lists some of them, based on RFC 7231.

## 1xx &mdash; Informational

### 100 Continue

Everything is good so far, and the client can continue (by sending another request). The server would send the final response once the full request have been received and processed.

**Sample usage:** Using `Expect: 100-continue` request header to check before sending a large message body. The server would respond by 100 (Continue) or 417 (Expectation Failed). (See: [Status code 100 example: large message body](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Expect#large_message_body).)

### 101 Switching Protocol

The server agrees to switch protocol listed on the `Upgrade` request header. (The response will also have the `Upgrade` response header, mentioning the protocol the server is switching to.)

**Sample usage:** [Switching protocol to websocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/101#examples)

## 2xx &mdash; Succesful

### 200 OK

The request has succeeded.

### 201 Created

The request has succeeded, and has resulted in new resource(s) being created. You can send the newly created resource in the response body, or using the `Location` response header.

### 202 Accepted

The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing itself has not been completed or has not been started (i.e. "in queue").

### 203 Non-Authoritative Information

The request has succeeded, but the response body has been modified by a proxy from the original 200 (OK) response.

### 204 No Content

The request has succeeded, and there's no content to send in the response body. This hints the user agent to not navigate away from the current page (and give the indication of succcess somehow).

**Sample usage:** "Save and continue editing" functionality for a wiki site.

### 205 Reset Content

The request has succeeded, and the user agent should reset the document view (e.g. to reset a form, UI, or canvas state).

### 206 Partial Content

The request has succeeded, and the response body contains the requested range of data as described in the `Range` request header. (See: [`Range` request header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Range), e.g. `Range: bytes=200-1000, 2000-6576, 19000-`.)

## 3xx &mdash; Redirection

### 300 Multiple Choices

Indicates the request has more than one possible responses (listed in the response body), and the user agent should pick one of them. If the server has a preferred choice, it should generate a `Location` response header.

Rarely used because of lack of standardization (MDN).

### 301 Moved Permanently

Indicates permanent redirection to the location pointed by the `Location` response header.

For historical reasons, some browsers may change the method used to hit the new URI with a GET method (RFC 7231). To keep using the original method, use 308 (Permanent Redirect) instead.

**Warning:** The user agent will usually remember this redirection and will not hit the old URI again. (You will need to delete the browser's preference to undo this.)

### 302 Found

Indicates temporary redirection to the location pointed by the `Location` response header.

For historical reasons, some browsers may change the method used to hit the new URI with a GET method (RFC 7231). To keep using the original method, use 307 (Temporary Redirect). If you want the method to be changed to GET, use 303 (See Other) instead.

### 303 See Other

Indicates that the server is redirecting the user agent to a different resource (e.g. a confirmation page, an upload progress page, or a representation of the actual resource being requested).

### 304 Not Modified

Indicates that there is no need to retransmit the requested resources (just use the cached version).

### 307 Temporary Redirect

Like 302 (Found), but does not allow changing the request method to GET.

### 308 Permanent Redirect

Like 301 (Moved Permanently), but does not allow changing the request method to GET.

## 4xx &mdash; Client Error

## 5xx &mdash; Server Error
