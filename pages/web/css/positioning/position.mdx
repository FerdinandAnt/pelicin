# Position

`position` property sets how an element is positioned in the document.

## Basic Concepts

A _positioned element_ is an element whose position value is set to `relative`, `absolute`, `sticky`, or `fixed`. (The default value is `static`.)

With positioned elements, you can tweak their final location using `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties.

## Position Property

<NoteBox
  type="warning"
  title={
    <>
      Scrolling element with <Code str="fixed" /> or <Code str="sticky" />
    </>
  }
>
  "Scrolling elements containing <Code str="fixed" /> or <Code str="sticky" /> content can cause
  performance and accessibility issues. As a user scrolls, the browser must repaint the sticky or
  fixed content in a new location." (MDN)
</NoteBox>

### `position`

Sets how an element is positioned in the document. Possible values:

<DocumentationList
  items={[
    {
      name: 'static',
      description: <>The element is positioned according to the normal document flow (default)</>,
    },
    {
      name: 'relative',
      description: (
        <>
          The element is positioned according to the normal document flow, and then offset relative
          to its original position according to the values of <Code str="top" />,{' '}
          <Code str="right" />, <Code str="bottom" />, <Code str="left" />.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: 'absolute',
      description: (
        <>
          The element is taken out from the normal document flow (no longer takes space in its
          original spot), and positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. The final
          position is set according to the values of <Code str="top" />, <Code str="right" />
          , <Code str="bottom" />, <Code str="left" />.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: 'fixed',
      description: (
        <>
          The element is taken out from the normal document flow (no longer takes space in its
          original spot), and positioned relative to the viewport. The final position is set
          according to the values of <Code str="top" />, <Code str="right" />
          , <Code str="bottom" />, <Code str="left" />.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: 'sticky',
      description: (
        <>
          The element is positioned according to the normal document flow, and then offset relative
          to the nearest "scrolling block-level ancestor" according to the values of{' '}
          <Code str="top" />, <Code str="right" />, <Code str="bottom" />, <Code str="left" />. (For
          example, if you set <Code str="top: 100px" />, it ensures that the element would stay at
          least 10px from the top of the scrolling container; if it would go below that, the element
          will "stick" at the top 10px of the scrolling container while the other content will
          continue scrolling.)
        </>
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>
