# HTML Entities

You can use HTML Entities to insert special characters to your HTML document.

They look like this (all of these inserts the '&copy;' [character](https://decodeunicode.org/u+00A9)):

- `&copy;` &mdash; using the character's entity mnemonic
- `&#169;` &mdash; using the character's decimal Unicode number (in this case, 169)
- `&#xA9;` &mdash; using the character's hex Unicode number (in this case, 0xA9)

<WebEditor
  html={smartTrim(`
    <p>&copy; 2021 Some Guy</p>
    <p>&#169; 2021 Some Other Guy</p>
    <p>&#xA9; 2021 &lt;you get the idea&gt;</p>
  `)}
/>

## Reserved characters

Sometimes, you can't enter these characters normally because they have special meaning in HTML (the browser could interpret them as HTML code).

In those cases, you will need to use their character entities.

| Character | Entity   | Note &mdash; without the use of entity                      |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| <         | `&lt;`   | Interpreted as the beginning of a tag                       |
| >         | `&gt;`   | Interpreted as the ending of a tag                          |
| &         | `&amp;`  | Interpreted as the beginning of an entity                   |
| "         | `&quot;` | Interpreted as the beginning/ending of an attribute's value |
